                  Traditional car rental processes often come with their fair
                  share of challenges and frustrations. The never-ending
                  paperwork, hidden fees, limited options, and complicated
                  reservation systems can make renting a car feel like a
                  daunting and time-consuming task. At Divvy, we&apos;ve recognized
                  these issues and embarked on a mission to revolutionize the

                  method, guaranteeing that it is hassle-free and user-friendly
                  for our customers.
