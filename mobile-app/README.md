# How to use

## Storybook

**Note** Storybook for React Native is different from storybook for web in a number of ways.

- Storybook for RN is only available in version 5.3.0 - 5.3.19, so you will be working with an older version of storybook.
- To view your stories in the browser you will have to run `npm run web` and then open the browser at http://localhost:19006, it will not work on the storybook app opened with `npm run storybook` on `port:7007`, view this issue for more info ðŸ‘‰ [the issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/3353)

### setting up

**Note** Inorder to view the stories in the app, you will first need to run `npm run storybook`, this will add your stories from wherever you have placed them within, either the components or screens folder (`this can be changed within the package.json to include any other folder you want`). Once that is done, you can run `npm run web` to open the app in the browser, and you shold see one of the bottom tab navigators labelled storybook, you can naigate to that and interact with your stories.

- To add a story, create a file with the extension `.stories.js/ts/tsx` in the components or screens folder, and add your stories to that file.

## Redux

For state management we are currently using redux with redux toolkit. The store related configurations are in the `store` folder.

## Testing

For testing we are using jest and react native testing library. jest related configurations are in the package.json file and the jest folder.

- When adding tests add them to the `__test__` folder within the component you are creating, this is to make the tests organized, so that we dont have the code generated by each test sprinkled around the same folder as your component.
